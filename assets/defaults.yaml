# - True:    Show slide number
# - False:   Hide slide number
#
# Can optionally be set as a string that specifies the number formatting:
# - "h.v":   Horizontal . vertical slide number (default)
# - "h/v":   Horizontal / vertical slide number
# - "c":   Flattened slide number
# - "c/t":   Flattened slide number / total slides
#
# Alternatively, you can provide a function that returns the slide
# number for the current slide. The function should take in a slide
# object and return an array with one string [slideNumber] or
# three strings [n1,delimiter,n2]. See #formatSlideNumber().
slideNumber: False

# Can be used to limit the contexts in which the slide number appears
# - "all":      Always show the slide number

#
# "linear"
# Removes the up/down arrows. Left/right arrows step through all
# slides (both horizontal and vertical).
#
# "grid"
# When this is enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack
# to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical
# index.
#
# Consider a deck with six slides ordered in two vertical stacks:
# 1.1    2.1
# 1.2    2.2
# 1.3    2.3
#
# If you're on slide 1.3 and navigate right, you will normally move

# from 1.3 -> 2.3.
